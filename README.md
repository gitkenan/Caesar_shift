# Caeser_shift
I created a way to encrypt and decipher text using the Caeser shift in Python 2.

## How to use this app
First download the words_alpha.txt file and caesershift2.py to the same directory.
Run with Powershell or command line. For encryption and decryption, the programme will currently only take lowercase strings with spaces and no other characters. 

Credit to https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for the words_alpha.txt file which 
I pull from for this caeser cipher programme, written in Python 2.
