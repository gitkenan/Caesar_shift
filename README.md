# Caeser_shift
I created a way to encrypt and decipher text using the Caeser shift in Python 2.

## How to use this app
Run with Powershell or equivalent Mac command line. For encryption and decryption, the programme will only take lowercase strings with spaces and no other characters.

I pull from for this caeser cipher programme, written in Python 2.
